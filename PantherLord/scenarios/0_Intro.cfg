			story= _ "My name is Daklo. I was a tribesman in the darklands until a few years ago. I befriended one of the animal earth-spirits for whom my kind have little appreciation. I became an outcast, but I didn't mind much. My friend walks beside me, and whether in man form or beast shape he keeps me safe."

			story= _ "Or as safe as I can be, I should say. I make my living as a mercenary, nowadays. It's a profession where my knack for swordplay serves me well."

		[part]
			story= _ "I was hired to help defend the Sea States.  Which I did.  But the rumors that have been circulating ever since our victory over the Imperialist Expansionist Faction worry me.  Everyone seems to think they plan to shift their focus away from the Sea States, and concentrate on subjugating the jungles of my homeland.  Though I am an outcast, I still love my people. I do not want to see them fall under the iron rule of the Imperialist Nation."
